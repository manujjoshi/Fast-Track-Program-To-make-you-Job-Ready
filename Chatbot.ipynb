    "## `Chatbot with RaSa`\n",
    "- Today, almost all companies have chatbots to engage their users and serve customers by catering to their queries. As per a report by Gartner, Chatbots will be handling 85% of the customer service interactions by the year 2020. Also, 80% of businesses are expected to have some sort of chatbot automation by 2020 (Outgrow, 2018). We practically will have chatbots everywhere, but this doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that all will be well-functioning. The challenge here is not to develop a chatbot, but to develop a well functioning one. \n",
